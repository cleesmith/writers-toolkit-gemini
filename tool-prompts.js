proofreader_spelling: `
Perform a comprehensive word-by-word spelling check on the entire document while being sensitive to intentional stylistic choices.

Your task:
1. Examine EVERY single word in sequence, comparing each against standard spelling
2. Specifically flag ALL instances of:
   - Misspelled words (e.g., 'teh' instead of 'the')
   - Missing apostrophes in contractions (e.g., 'dont' instead of 'don't')
   - Incorrect homophone usage (e.g., 'their' when 'there' is needed)
   - Common pattern errors (dropping double letters, 'ie' vs 'ei' errors)

3. DISTINGUISH between true spelling errors and intentional stylistic choices by considering:
   - Is the word in dialogue or a character's thoughts?
   - Does it reflect a character's established speech pattern or education level?
   - Is it consistent with the character's voice throughout the story?
   - Is it a recognized colloquialism, slang term, or regional dialect?
   - Does it appear to be an intentional creative choice?

Format your response differently based on the type of issue:

FOR GENUINE SPELLING ERRORS:
---------
Original: [The passage containing the error]
Issue(s): Spelling - [Describe the specific error]
Correction/Suggestion: [The corrected passage]

FOR POSSIBLE STYLISTIC CHOICES:
---------
Original: [The passage containing the non-standard usage]
Note: This appears to be intentional non-standard language that might reflect [character voice/dialect/colloquial speech/etc.]. While not standard usage, this may be a stylistic choice rather than an error.
Consider: [Brief note on whether this is consistent with the character's established voice or if it might be an unintentional error]

Examples of stylistic choices that should NOT be marked as errors (unless inconsistent with the character):
- Non-standard words used in dialogue ("ain't", "gonna", "wanna")
- Child-like speech ("bestest", "funnest")
- Dialectal spellings showing accent ("fer" for "for", "ya" for "you")
- Character-specific speech patterns (dropped g's like "talkin'", simplified words)
- Established slang or colloquialisms

When in doubt about whether something is an error or stylistic choice:
1. Check if it's consistent with how the character speaks/thinks elsewhere
2. Note it as a possible stylistic choice rather than definitively marking it as an error
3. Suggest the standard spelling but indicate it may be intentional

For the "Correction/Suggestion:" line, provide the directly corrected sentence.

proofreader_plot_consistency: `
You are a professional plot consistency proofreader focused on analyzing this manuscript:

CORE INSTRUCTION: Conduct a specialized review focusing EXCLUSIVELY on plot consistency issues. Thoroughly analyze story elements, important objects, character knowledge, fictional world rules, and narrative causality to identify contradictions, plot holes, or inconsistencies in how the story unfolds.

FOCUS ONLY ON:
- Fictional world rule contradictions (how magic, technology, or special abilities work)
- Plot causality issues (events happening without logical setup or connection)
- Knowledge inconsistencies (characters knowing things they shouldn't yet know or forgetting what they should know)
- Important object inconsistencies (items appearing, disappearing, or changing without explanation)
- Motivation inconsistencies (characters acting contrary to established goals without development)
- Narrative promises unfulfilled (setup without payoff, introduced elements that vanish)
- Factual contradictions within the story's established reality
- Information revealed to readers that conflicts with previous information

EXPLICITLY IGNORE:
- Spelling, grammar, punctuation, and formatting errors
- Character consistency issues (unless directly affecting plot)
- Timeline and chronology inconsistencies (unless directly affecting plot)
- Setting and location consistency issues (unless directly affecting plot)
- Stylistic choices and thematic elements
- Any other issues not directly related to plot and world-building consistency

APPROACH:
1. Track the story's internal logic and rules as you read through the manuscript
2. Monitor:
   - Important objects and their status/location
   - Information revealed to different characters and when
   - Rules established for how the world functions
   - Cause-and-effect relationships between events
   - Setup elements that promise later payoff
3. Identify contradictions, logical gaps, or inconsistencies in these elements
4. Present specific instances where plot elements appear inconsistent

PLOT ELEMENT TRACKING FORMAT:
For each significant plot element, create an entry with:
- Description of the element (object, knowledge, rule, etc.)
- When and how it's established in the narrative
- How it's used or referenced throughout the story
- Any changes or developments to the element

ISSUE REPORTING FORMAT:
For each plot inconsistency found:
- Number sequentially (e.g., "Plot Inconsistency #1")
- Show BOTH relevant text passages VERBATIM without adding quotation marks
- Explain the specific inconsistency
- Suggest a possible resolution if appropriate

EXAMPLE:
Plot Inconsistency #1:
First passage: The ancient amulet could only be destroyed in the fires where it was forged, deep within Mount Doom. No other force in the world could break it.
Second passage: With a mighty swing of his sword, Aragorn shattered the amulet into a thousand pieces, releasing its dark power into the wind.
Issue: The rules established for the amulet are contradictory. Initially, it's stated that the amulet can only be destroyed in a specific location (Mount Doom) and that no other force can break it. Later, a character destroys it with a conventional weapon without explanation.
Possible resolution: Either modify the initial rule about the amulet's invulnerability, explain how Aragorn's sword has special properties that allow it to break the rule, or revise the destruction scene to align with the established rules.

FINAL REPORT:
Provide a summary of key plot elements and established world rules, followed by all identified plot inconsistencies.

VERIFICATION:
At the end, confirm you checked ONLY for plot consistency issues and ignored all other types of issues as instructed.

dangling_modifier_checker: `
You are an expert literary editor specializing in grammatical clarity and precision. Your task is to analyze the provided manuscript for dangling and misplaced modifiers.

Follow Ursula K. Le Guin's guidance from "Steering the Craft" on the importance of clear, precise sentence construction. Dangling modifiers occur when a descriptive phrase doesn't connect logically to what it's supposed to modify, creating confusion or unintentional humor. In her words, "danglers can really wreck the scenery."

Pay special attention to:
1. Introductory phrases that don't logically connect to the subject that follows
   Example: "Walking down the street, the trees were beautiful." (Who is walking?)
   Corrected: "Walking down the street, I thought the trees were beautiful."

2. Participial phrases (-ing, -ed) that appear to modify the wrong noun
   Example: "Rushing to catch the train, my coffee spilled everywhere." (The coffee wasn't rushing)
   Corrected: "Rushing to catch the train, I spilled my coffee everywhere."

3. Modifiers placed too far from what they're modifying
   Example: "She served cake to the children on paper plates." (Were the children on paper plates?)
   Corrected: "She served cake on paper plates to the children."

4. Limiting modifiers (only, just, nearly, almost) that modify the wrong element
   Example: "He only eats vegetables on Tuesdays." (Does he do nothing else with vegetables on Tuesdays?)
   Corrected: "He eats vegetables only on Tuesdays."

5. Squinting modifiers that could apply to either what comes before or after
   Example: "Drinking coffee quickly improves alertness." (Does "quickly" modify drinking or improves?)
   Corrected: "Quickly drinking coffee improves alertness." OR "Drinking coffee improves alertness quickly."

crowding_leaping_evaluator: `
You are an expert literary editor specializing in narrative pacing and structure. Your task is to analyze the provided manuscript for crowding and leaping patterns.

Follow Ursula K. Le Guin's concepts from "Steering the Craft" on controlling scene density through "crowding" (adding intense detail) and "leaping" (jumping over time or events). According to Le Guin, mastering these techniques allows writers to control the reader's experience through the density and sparseness of the narrative.

Pay special attention to:
1. CROWDED SECTIONS
   - Paragraphs with intense sensory detail or many quick events
   - Sections where multiple significant actions occur in rapid succession
   - Dense descriptive passages that may overwhelm the reader
   Example: "She grabbed her keys, slammed the door, ran down three flights of stairs, hailed a cab, jumped in, gave the address, texted her boss, checked her makeup, and rehearsed her presentation all before the first stoplight."

2. LEAPING SECTIONS
   - Abrupt jumps in time, location, or perspective without sufficient transition
   - Places where significant events happen "off-screen" between scenes
   - Transitions that may leave readers disoriented or confused
   Example: "John left the party early. Three years later, he returned to find everything had changed."

3. TRANSITION EFFECTIVENESS
   - How smoothly the narrative moves between scenes, settings, and time periods
   - Whether transitions provide enough context for readers to follow leaps
   - If scene changes use appropriate pacing techniques for the content
   Example (effective): "As winter gave way to spring, so too did her grief begin to thaw." 
   Example (ineffective): "They argued bitterly. The wedding was beautiful."

4. PACING PATTERNS
   - Repetitive structures that may create monotony
   - Consistent density that doesn't vary with narrative importance
   - Opportunities to use crowding and leaping more strategically
   Example (problem): Five consecutive scenes that all use the same dense detail level regardless of importance
   Suggestion: Vary detail level to emphasize key moments and quicken pace for transitions

For each pacing issue you identify, provide:
- The relevant passage with the crowding or leaping pattern
- An analysis of its effect on reader experience and narrative flow
- A suggested revision approach that maintains the author's voice and intent

Create a comprehensive pacing analysis with these sections:
1. PACING OVERVIEW:

   - Identify paragraphs with intense detail or many events happening quickly
   - Flag sections where the narrative feels dense or overwhelming
   - Note effective use of crowding for emphasis or dramatic effect
   - Provide examples with suggestions for potential adjustment

3. LEAPING ANALYSIS:
   - Identify sections where significant time or events are skipped
   - Point out abrupt transitions that may confuse readers
   - Highlight effective uses of leaping to maintain narrative momentum
   - Suggest improvements for leaps that lack necessary context or bridges

4. TRANSITION ANALYSIS:
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of scene and chapter transitions
   - Identify transitions that are too abrupt or too drawn out
   - Analyze how transitions contribute to or detract from pacing
   - Suggest ways to improve problematic transitions

   - Examine how effectively "white space" is used between scenes and events
   - Analyze the presence and absence of reflective or transitional passages
   - Identify opportunities for adding or removing breathing room
   - Suggest techniques for modulating narrative density

8. GENRE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Evaluate pacing against genre expectations and conventions
   - Analyze how crowding and leaping affect genre-specific elements
   - Identify pacing strategies that would enhance genre effectiveness
   - Suggest tailored approaches for improving genre alignment

9. PACING VISUALIZATION:
   - Create a text-based visualization that represents the pacing patterns
   - Use symbols to indicate dense/crowded sections (e.g., "###") and leaps/transitions (e.g., "->")
   - Map the pacing flow throughout the manuscript to identify rhythm patterns

foreshadowing_tracker: `
You are an expert fiction editor specializing in narrative structure and foreshadowing. 
Analyze the manuscript to identify EXPLICIT foreshadowing elements - direct hints, statements, or events that point to future developments.

Focus on identifying:

1. DIRECT FORESHADOWING:
   - Clear statements or hints that explicitly point to future events
   - Prophecies, predictions, or warnings made by characters
   - Narrative statements that directly hint at what's to come
   - Character statements that foreshadow future developments

2. SETUP AND PAYOFF TRACKING:
   - For each foreshadowing element, locate where it is set up (the hint/clue)
   - Identify where/if each setup is paid off later in the manuscript
   - Note any explicit foreshadowing that remains unresolved
   - Analyze the effectiveness of the setup-payoff connections

3. TIMING AND DISTANCE ASSESSMENT:
   - Evaluate the distance between setup and payoff (immediate, mid-range, long-range)
   - Assess if the timing between setup and payoff is appropriate
   - Note if foreshadowed events occur too quickly or are delayed too long

4. NARRATIVE IMPACT:
   - Analyze how the foreshadowing enhances tension and anticipation
   - Assess if the foreshadowing is too obvious or too subtle
   - Evaluate if the payoff satisfies the expectations created by the setup


Organize your analysis chronologically, following the manuscript's progression.

For each foreshadowing element, provide:
- The exact text and location where the foreshadowing occurs
- The exact text and location where the payoff occurs (if present)
- An assessment of the effectiveness of the setup-payoff connection
- Recommendations for improvement where relevant

For unresolved foreshadowing, note:
- The setup that lacks a payoff
- Where a payoff could naturally occur
- Specific suggestions for resolving the planted clue

Use the extensive thinking space to thoroughly catalog and cross-reference all foreshadowing elements before finalizing your analysis.


Analyze the manuscript to identify IMPLICIT foreshadowing elements - subtle clues, symbolic imagery, and thematic elements that hint at future developments.

Focus on identifying:

1. SYMBOLIC FORESHADOWING:
   - Recurring symbols, motifs, or imagery that hint at future events
   - Visual descriptions that subtly indicate coming developments
   - Metaphors or similes that suggest future outcomes
   - Environmental details (weather, setting) that subtly presage events

2. DIALOGUE FORESHADOWING:
   - Casual remarks by characters that gain significance later
   - Seemingly unimportant information revealed in dialogue
   - Character observations that subtly hint at future revelations
   - Patterns in dialogue that create expectations

3. BACKGROUND DETAILS:
   - Seemingly minor world-building elements that become important
   - Casual mentions of places, objects, or people that later become significant
   - Incidental actions or habits that foreshadow character choices

4. PATTERN RECOGNITION:
   - Track recurring themes or ideas that create expectations
   - Identify narrative patterns that implicitly suggest outcomes
   - Note subtle character behaviors that foreshadow major decisions

Organize your analysis chronologically, following the manuscript's progression.

For each implicit foreshadowing element, provide:
- The exact text and location where the subtle clue appears
- The exact text and location of the corresponding payoff (if present)
- An analysis of how the subtle connection works (or doesn't)
- Recommendations for strengthening subtle connections where relevant

For potential missed opportunities, identify:
- Events that would benefit from earlier foreshadowing
- Suggestions for subtle clues that could be planted earlier
- Ways to enhance thematic coherence through implicit connections

Use the extensive thinking space to thoroughly catalog and cross-reference all implicit elements before finalizing your analysis.


Now, perform "Chekhov's Gun" analysis - the principle that significant elements introduced in a story must be used in a meaningful way. Analyze the manuscript to identify introduced elements that create expectations for later use.

Focus on identifying:

1. INTRODUCED BUT UNUSED ELEMENTS:
   - Significant objects that are prominently described but not used
   - Special abilities, skills, or knowledge mentioned but never employed
   - Locations described in detail but not utilized in the plot
   - Character traits or backgrounds emphasized but not made relevant

2. PROPERLY UTILIZED ELEMENTS:
   - Significant objects, places, or abilities that are introduced and later used
   - The setup of these elements and their subsequent payoff
   - How effectively the payoff fulfills the expectation created by the setup

3. SETUP-PAYOFF EVALUATION:
   - Whether the payoff is proportional to the emphasis placed on the setup
   - If the payoff occurs at an appropriate time after the setup
   - Whether the use of the element is satisfying given how it was introduced

4. NARRATIVE PROMISE ASSESSMENT:
   - Identify what narrative promises are made to readers through introduced elements
   - Evaluate whether these promises are fulfilled
   - Assess the impact of unfulfilled narrative promises on reader satisfaction

Organize your analysis chronologically, following the manuscript's progression.

For each Chekhov's Gun element, provide:
- The exact text and location where the element is introduced
- The exact text and location where the element is used (if it is)
- An assessment of the effectiveness of the setup-payoff
- Specific recommendations for elements that need resolution

For unfired Chekhov's Guns, suggest:
- How the introduced element could be meaningfully incorporated
- Where in the narrative the payoff could naturally occur
- How to revise the introduction if the element won't be used

Use the extensive thinking space to thoroughly catalog all introduced significant elements and their resolution status before finalizing your analysis.
