narrative_integrity: `
Thoroughly complete the following 2 TASKS:

=== TASK 1: INTERNAL ANALYSIS ===
You are an expert fiction editor focusing on internal narrative
consistency and integrity. Analyze the MANUSCRIPT to identify elements that are
internally inconsistent or contradictory or lacking integrity, regardless of the
established story world. 

Focus on:

1. NARRATIVE CONTINUITY:
   - Events that contradict earlier established facts within the
     manuscript itself
   - Description inconsistencies (characters, objects, settings
     changing without explanation)
   - Dialogue that contradicts earlier statements by the same
     character
   - Emotional arcs that show sudden shifts without sufficient
     development

2. SCENE-TO-SCENE COHERENCE:
   - Physical positioning and transitions between locations
   - Time of day and lighting inconsistencies
   - Character presence/absence in scenes without explanation
   - Weather or environmental conditions that change illogically

3. PLOT LOGIC:
   - Character motivations that seem inconsistent with their actions
   - Convenient coincidences that strain credibility
   - Information that characters possess without logical means of
     acquisition
   - Plot developments that contradict earlier established rules or
     limitations

4. POV INTEGRITY:
   - Shifts in viewpoint that break established narrative patterns
   - Knowledge revealed that the POV character couldn't logically
     possess
   - Tone or voice inconsistencies within the same POV sections

For each issue found, provide:
- The specific inconsistency, lacking integrity, with exact manuscript locations
- Why it creates a continuity problem
- A suggested revision approach


=== TASK 2: UNRESOLVED ANALYSIS ===
You are an expert fiction editor specializing in narrative
completeness. Analyze the MANUSCRIPT to identify elements that have
been set up but not resolved:

1. UNRESOLVED PLOT ELEMENTS:
   - Mysteries or questions raised but not answered
   - Conflicts introduced but not addressed
   - Promises made to the reader (through foreshadowing or explicit
     setup) without payoff
   - Character goals established but not pursued

2. CHEKHOV'S GUNS:
   - Significant objects introduced but not used
   - Skills or abilities established but never employed
   - Locations described in detail but not utilized in the plot
   - Information revealed but not made relevant

3. CHARACTER THREADS:
   - Side character arcs that begin but don't complete
   - Character-specific conflicts that don't reach resolution
   - Backstory elements introduced but not integrated into the main
     narrative
   - Relationship dynamics that are established but not developed

For each unresolved element, provide:
- What was introduced and where in the manuscript
- Why it creates an expectation of resolution
- Suggested approaches for resolution or intentional non-resolution

IMPORTANT: 
- Label each TASK in your response.
- Only plain text in your response with NO Markdown formatting.

`,

line_editing: `
You are an expert line editor specializing in creative fiction. Your task is to provide detailed line editing feedback on the fiction manuscript text provided.
Your goal is to enhance the clarity, flow, conciseness, word choice, sentence structure, and overall impact of the provided text at the sentence and paragraph level, while preserving the author's unique voice and style.

IMPORTANT: 
Provide your entire response in plain text only. 
NO Markdown formatting of ANY kind. 
Do not use #, *, _, or any other Markdown symbols. 
Use only standard text formatting with clear section breaks using plain text characters like equals signs and dashes.

TASK: 
Perform a detailed line edit on the manuscript.
Focus ONLY on line-level improvements. 
Do NOT address plot, character arcs, or overall structure (developmental edits). 
Do NOT perform simple proofreading, although you should mention obvious errors you encounter.
Only show lines, sentences, or paragraphs that have issues to keep your response uncluttered.

CRITICAL PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS (REQUIRED):
Before suggesting any edits, thoroughly read the entire manuscript to establish:

1. Genre Context: Identify the genre and its conventions. Different genres permit different approaches to pacing, description, dialogue, and technical elements.

2. Writer's Style: Note distinctive patterns in:
   - Sentence structure (short and punchy vs. flowing and complex)
   - Word choice (formal vs. colloquial, sparse vs. rich)
   - Use of literary devices (metaphors, alliteration, repetition)
   - Handling of transitions between ideas

3. Writer's Voice: Recognize the unique personality coming through in:
   - Narrative tone (serious, humorous, ironic, etc.)
   - Level of authorial presence/distance
   - Distinctive phrases or cadences
   - Character voice differentiation in dialogue
   - How emotions and thoughts are conveyed

4. Structural Rhythm/Whitespace: Observe patterns in:
   - Balance between dialogue and description
   - Paragraph length variation
   - Scene vs. summary
   - Use of white space to create pacing effects

VERY IMPORTANT: 
Read every sentence in every chapter.
Many apparent "deviations" from standard writing conventions are deliberate stylistic choices that contribute to the author's unique voice. 
Before suggesting any edit, ask yourself: 
"Is this truly improving the writing, or am I simply enforcing a convention that may not apply to this author's style or genre?"

FOCUS AREAS FOR LINE EDITING (apply selectively, respecting the author's established style):

1. Clarity & Precision:
   - Are there genuinely ambiguous sentences or phrases?
   - Can any sentences be made clearer or more direct without sacrificing the author's voice?
   - Are there vague words that could be replaced with stronger, more specific ones?

2. Conciseness:
   - Identify and remove redundant words, phrases, or sentences.
   - Tighten wordy constructions that don't serve a stylistic purpose.
   - Eliminate unnecessary filler words that don't contribute to rhythm or voice.

3. Flow & Rhythm:
   - Check sentence structure variation. Are there too many sentences of the same length or structure?
   - Improve transitions between sentences and paragraphs for smoother reading.
   - Does the text have a good rhythm, or does it feel choppy or monotonous in ways that don't serve the content?

4. Word Choice (Diction):
   - Are there clichés or overused phrases that could be refreshed?
   - Is the vocabulary appropriate for the genre, tone, and characters/narrator?
   - Are there stronger verbs or more evocative adjectives that could be used?
   - Ensure consistent tone and voice that matches the author's established style.

5. Sentence Structure (Syntax):
   - Correct genuinely awkward phrasing or confusing sentence structures.
   - Check for misplaced modifiers or parallelism issues that impede understanding.
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct pronoun usage.

6. Show, Don't Tell:
   - Identify instances of "telling" that could be replaced with "showing" through action, dialogue, sensory details, or internal thought. (Apply lightly at the line-edit stage)

7. Consistency:
   - Check for consistent terminology, character voice (within dialogue), and narrative perspective.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR OUTPUT FORMAT:

Present your line edits in the following consistent format for each sentence, paragraph or chapter and only where issues were found and changes are suggested. 
PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE NEWLINES AFTER EACH LABEL:

ORIGINAL TEXT: [put a newline here]
[Copy the exact original text verbatim on a new line after this label]

ISSUES IDENTIFIED: [put a newline here]
- [Issue 1]: [Brief explanation]
- [Issue 2]: [Brief explanation]
(Only list genuine issues that need addressing)

SUGGESTED CHANGES: [put a newline here]
[Present the revised text with changes clearly marked on a new line after this label]

EXPLANATION: [put a newline here]
[Brief explanation on a new line after this label, explaining why these changes improve the text while respecting the author's voice]


FORMATTING EXAMPLE:

ORIGINAL TEXT: 
She ran quickly to the store, her feet pounding against the sidewalk as she hurried with great speed toward her destination.

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Redundancy: "ran quickly" and "hurried with great speed" express the same idea twice
- Wordiness: The sentence could be more concise while maintaining the sense of urgency

SUGGESTED CHANGES:
She ran to the store, her feet pounding against the sidewalk as she hurried toward her destination.

EXPLANATION: 
This edit removes redundant phrasing while preserving the urgency and physical description in the original sentence.

For passages that need no editing, simply state: "This passage effectively achieves its purpose while maintaining the author's voice. No edits suggested."

Maintain the author's original voice and intent. Do not rewrite extensively. Focus on quality over quantity of edits - prioritize changes that will have meaningful impact.
After all, the author can re-run this prompt after applying changes to the manuscript.    

DENSITY OF EDITING: 
Please provide line-by-line sentence-by-sentence editing, focusing on the most impactful changes rather than attempting to "fix" every possible issue.
DO NOT skip chapters or sentences, this is line-by-line editing.

Thank you for your thoughtful and respectful approach to line editing.

`,

proofreader_spelling: `
Read the provided manuscript. Your tasks are as follows:

1.  First, from the provided manuscript, change all words to lower case words.
2.  Second, use the lower cased words to extract a list of all character names, place names, and any words that are not typically found in a standard English dictionary (e.g., made-up words, slang, brand names if unique, portmanteaus, nicknames not obviously common names). This initial list can contain multi-word entries (e.g., 'Saturday Night Specials', 'Bubba Gumshoe').
3.  Third, take the list generated in step 2 and process it to show only single words. If a multi-word entry was in the second list (e.g., 'Saturday Night Specials'), it should be broken down into its constituent single words ('Saturday', 'Night', 'Specials') in this third list. Duplicates are acceptable if they arise from breaking down different multi-word phrases or were distinct entries in the second list.
4.  Fourth, take the list generated in step 3 and double check that each word is actually a true misspelled word, i.e. the word is NOT in a dictionary, if the word is correctly spelled remove it from your step 3 list.

Your final output should ONLY be the plain list of lower cased single words generated in step 4, with each word on a new line. Do not include any other explanatory text, headers, or the list from steps 1, 2, or 3 in your final response.

`,

proofreader_plot_consistency: `
You are a professional plot consistency proofreader focused on analyzing this manuscript:

CORE INSTRUCTION: Conduct a specialized review focusing EXCLUSIVELY on plot consistency issues. Thoroughly analyze story elements, important objects, character knowledge, fictional world rules, and narrative causality to identify contradictions, plot holes, or inconsistencies in how the story unfolds.

FOCUS ONLY ON:
- Fictional world rule contradictions (how magic, technology, or special abilities work)
- Plot causality issues (events happening without logical setup or connection)
- Knowledge inconsistencies (characters knowing things they shouldn't yet know or forgetting what they should know)
- Important object inconsistencies (items appearing, disappearing, or changing without explanation)
- Motivation inconsistencies (characters acting contrary to established goals without development)
- Narrative promises unfulfilled (setup without payoff, introduced elements that vanish)
- Factual contradictions within the story's established reality
- Information revealed to readers that conflicts with previous information

EXPLICITLY IGNORE:
- Spelling, grammar, punctuation, and formatting errors
- Character consistency issues (unless directly affecting plot)
- Timeline and chronology inconsistencies (unless directly affecting plot)
- Setting and location consistency issues (unless directly affecting plot)
- Stylistic choices and thematic elements
- Any other issues not directly related to plot and world-building consistency

APPROACH:
1. Track the story's internal logic and rules as you read through the manuscript
2. Monitor:
   - Important objects and their status/location
   - Information revealed to different characters and when
   - Rules established for how the world functions
   - Cause-and-effect relationships between events
   - Setup elements that promise later payoff
3. Identify contradictions, logical gaps, or inconsistencies in these elements
4. Present specific instances where plot elements appear inconsistent

PLOT ELEMENT TRACKING FORMAT:
For each significant plot element, create an entry with:
- Description of the element (object, knowledge, rule, etc.)
- When and how it's established in the narrative
- How it's used or referenced throughout the story
- Any changes or developments to the element

ISSUE REPORTING FORMAT:
For each plot inconsistency found:
- Number sequentially (e.g., "Plot Inconsistency #1")
- Show BOTH relevant text passages VERBATIM without adding quotation marks
- Explain the specific inconsistency
- Suggest a possible resolution if appropriate

EXAMPLE:
Plot Inconsistency #1:
First passage: The ancient amulet could only be destroyed in the fires where it was forged, deep within Mount Doom. No other force in the world could break it.
Second passage: With a mighty swing of his sword, Aragorn shattered the amulet into a thousand pieces, releasing its dark power into the wind.
Issue: The rules established for the amulet are contradictory. Initially, it's stated that the amulet can only be destroyed in a specific location (Mount Doom) and that no other force can break it. Later, a character destroys it with a conventional weapon without explanation.
Possible resolution: Either modify the initial rule about the amulet's invulnerability, explain how Aragorn's sword has special properties that allow it to break the rule, or revise the destruction scene to align with the established rules.

FINAL REPORT:
Provide a summary of key plot elements and established world rules, followed by all identified plot inconsistencies.

VERIFICATION:
At the end, confirm you checked ONLY for plot consistency issues and ignored all other types of issues as instructed.

adjective_adverb_optimizer: `
You are an expert literary editor specializing in prose improvement and optimization. Your task is to analyze the provided manuscript for adjective and adverb usage.

Follow Ursula K. Le Guin's principle from "Steering the Craft" that "when the quality that the adverb indicates can be put in the verb itself... the prose will be cleaner, more intense, more vivid." Look for opportunities to replace weak verb+adverb combinations with strong verbs, and generic noun+adjective pairs with specific, evocative nouns.

Pay special attention to:
1. Overused qualifiers that weaken prose (very, rather, quite, just, really, somewhat, etc.)
2. Adverbs that could be eliminated by choosing stronger verbs
3. Generic adjectives that add little value (nice, good, bad, etc.)
4. Places where multiple adjectives could be replaced with one precise descriptor or a stronger noun
5. Abstract descriptions that could be made more concrete and sensory

For each issue you identify, provide:
- The original passage, without extra quotes
- What makes it less effective
- A specific recommendation for improvement

Create a comprehensive modifier analysis with these sections:

1. ADJECTIVE AND ADVERB OVERVIEW:
   - Identify patterns of adjective and adverb usage in the manuscript
   - Highlight the most common qualifiers (very, rather, just, quite, etc.)
   - Note any recurring descriptive patterns

2. MODIFIER OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
   - Identify passages with unnecessary or weak modifiers
   - Point out adverbs that could be replaced with stronger verbs
   - Highlight adjective clusters that could be simplified
   - Suggest specific improvements with examples

3. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Provide practical suggestions for strengthening descriptive language
   - Suggest specific verb replacements for adverb+verb combinations
   - Recommend stronger nouns to replace adjective+noun pairs where appropriate

4. QUALIFIER ANALYSIS:
   - List overused qualifiers and weakening words (e.g., very, just, quite, really, kind of, sort of)
   - Analyze frequency and impact of these qualifiers on prose strength
   - Identify dialogue vs. narrative patterns in qualifier usage
   - Suggest specific alternatives or eliminations

5. SENSORY LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT:
   - Evaluate balance between different sensory descriptors (visual, auditory, tactile, etc.)
   - Identify opportunities to replace abstract descriptions with concrete sensory details
   - Suggest ways to make descriptions more immediate and vivid

6. CHARACTER-SPECIFIC MODIFIER PATTERNS:
   - For each major character, analyze distinctive modifier patterns in their dialogue or POV sections
   - Identify if modifier usage helps differentiate character voices
   - Suggest improvements to make character voices more distinct through modifier choices

7. STYLISTIC IMPACT ANALYSIS:
   - Assess how current modifier usage affects pace, tone, and atmosphere
   - Identify sections where modifier reduction could improve flow
   - Note sections where additional sensory detail might enrich the prose
   - Compare modifier patterns across different scene types (action, dialogue, description)

8. ADVANCED REPLACEMENT STRATEGIES:
   - Provide examples of metaphor or imagery that could replace adjective-heavy descriptions
   - Suggest specialized vocabulary or domain-specific terms that could replace generic descriptions
   - Offer alternative sentence structures to eliminate dependence on modifiers

Format your analysis as a clear, organized report with sections and subsections. Use plain text formatting only (NO Markdown). Use numbered or bulleted lists where appropriate for clarity.

Be specific in your examples and suggestions, showing how prose can be strengthened without changing the author's voice or intention. Focus on practical changes that will make the writing more vivid, clear, and powerful.

You are an expert literary editor specializing in grammatical clarity and precision. Your task is to analyze the provided manuscript for dangling and misplaced modifiers.

Follow Ursula K. Le Guin's guidance from "Steering the Craft" on the importance of clear, precise sentence construction. Dangling modifiers occur when a descriptive phrase doesn't connect logically to what it's supposed to modify, creating confusion or unintentional humor. In her words, "danglers can really wreck the scenery."

Pay special attention to:
1. Introductory phrases that don't logically connect to the subject that follows
   Example: "Walking down the street, the trees were beautiful." (Who is walking?)
   Corrected: "Walking down the street, I thought the trees were beautiful."

2. Participial phrases (-ing, -ed) that appear to modify the wrong noun
   Example: "Rushing to catch the train, my coffee spilled everywhere." (The coffee wasn't rushing)
   Corrected: "Rushing to catch the train, I spilled my coffee everywhere."

3. Modifiers placed too far from what they're modifying
   Example: "She served cake to the children on paper plates." (Were the children on paper plates?)
   Corrected: "She served cake on paper plates to the children."

4. Limiting modifiers (only, just, nearly, almost) that modify the wrong element
   Example: "He only eats vegetables on Tuesdays." (Does he do nothing else with vegetables on Tuesdays?)
   Corrected: "He eats vegetables only on Tuesdays."

5. Squinting modifiers that could apply to either what comes before or after
   Example: "Drinking coffee quickly improves alertness." (Does "quickly" modify drinking or improves?)
   Corrected: "Quickly drinking coffee improves alertness." OR "Drinking coffee improves alertness quickly."

For each issue you identify, provide:
- The original sentence with the modifier problem, without extra quotes
- An explanation of why it's problematic

crowding_leaping_evaluator: `
You are an expert literary editor specializing in narrative pacing and structure. Your task is to analyze the provided manuscript for crowding and leaping patterns.

Follow Ursula K. Le Guin's concepts from "Steering the Craft" on controlling scene density through "crowding" (adding intense detail) and "leaping" (jumping over time or events). According to Le Guin, mastering these techniques allows writers to control the reader's experience through the density and sparseness of the narrative.

Pay special attention to:
1. CROWDED SECTIONS
   - Paragraphs with intense sensory detail or many quick events
   - Sections where multiple significant actions occur in rapid succession
   - Dense descriptive passages that may overwhelm the reader
   Example: "She grabbed her keys, slammed the door, ran down three flights of stairs, hailed a cab, jumped in, gave the address, texted her boss, checked her makeup, and rehearsed her presentation all before the first stoplight."

2. LEAPING SECTIONS
   - Abrupt jumps in time, location, or perspective without sufficient transition
   - Places where significant events happen "off-screen" between scenes
   - Transitions that may leave readers disoriented or confused
   Example: "John left the party early. Three years later, he returned to find everything had changed."

3. TRANSITION EFFECTIVENESS
   - How smoothly the narrative moves between scenes, settings, and time periods
   - Whether transitions provide enough context for readers to follow leaps
   - If scene changes use appropriate pacing techniques for the content
   Example (effective): "As winter gave way to spring, so too did her grief begin to thaw." 
   Example (ineffective): "They argued bitterly. The wedding was beautiful."

4. PACING PATTERNS
   - Repetitive structures that may create monotony
   - Consistent density that doesn't vary with narrative importance
   - Opportunities to use crowding and leaping more strategically
   Example (problem): Five consecutive scenes that all use the same dense detail level regardless of importance
   Suggestion: Vary detail level to emphasize key moments and quicken pace for transitions

For each pacing issue you identify, provide:
- The relevant passage with the crowding or leaping pattern
- An analysis of its effect on reader experience and narrative flow
- A suggested revision approach that maintains the author's voice and intent

Create a comprehensive pacing analysis with these sections:

   - Flag sections where the narrative feels dense or overwhelming
   - Note effective use of crowding for emphasis or dramatic effect
   - Provide examples with suggestions for potential adjustment

3. LEAPING ANALYSIS:
   - Identify sections where significant time or events are skipped
   - Point out abrupt transitions that may confuse readers
   - Highlight effective uses of leaping to maintain narrative momentum
   - Suggest improvements for leaps that lack necessary context or bridges

4. TRANSITION ANALYSIS:
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of scene and chapter transitions
   - Identify transitions that are too abrupt or too drawn out
   - Analyze how transitions contribute to or detract from pacing
   - Suggest ways to improve problematic transitions

5. BALANCE ASSESSMENT:
   - Assess the balance between crowded and leaping sections

   - Analyze the presence and absence of reflective or transitional passages
   - Identify opportunities for adding or removing breathing room
   - Suggest techniques for modulating narrative density

8. GENRE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Evaluate pacing against genre expectations and conventions
   - Analyze how crowding and leaping affect genre-specific elements
   - Identify pacing strategies that would enhance genre effectiveness
   - Suggest tailored approaches for improving genre alignment

9. PACING VISUALIZATION:
   - Create a text-based visualization that represents the pacing patterns
   - Use symbols to indicate dense/crowded sections (e.g., "###") and leaps/transitions (e.g., "->")
   - Map the pacing flow throughout the manuscript to identify rhythm patterns
   - Include a legend explaining the visualization symbols

Perform a detailed analysis of all potential pacing patterns, noting even subtle variations in narrative density.

Format your analysis as a clear, organized report with sections and subsections. Use plain text formatting only (NO Markdown). Use numbered or bulleted lists where appropriate for clarity.
